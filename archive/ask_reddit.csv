Comment,1,hcaf574,,0,1631262740.0,"When I was in my last year of undergraduate I was in a bunch of student clubs and societies. One of them was an atheist/secularist one and a bunch of them would always post about how stupid anyone who believes in God is and how they don't know anything about science.

It was fairly amusing to find one of them in the physics class I was a TA for the next semester. Like bruh shouldn't you be teaching me??",2021-09-10 11:32:20

Comment,1,hcaf0b9,,0,1631262611.0,"My dad died about 5 years ago. He was a good person, and always tried to see the best in other people. He was sick for a long time, and so it wasn‚Äôt unexpected, but still very sad.

I‚Äôm not going to sugarcoat it: if you have a good relationship with anyone, and they die, it‚Äôs going to suck. Hard. You are going to feel like the colour has left the world, that laughing is disrespectful to their memory, and you‚Äôre going to have the thought of ‚Äúoh, I should ask them about... no... wait.... they‚Äôre dead‚Äù and it‚Äôll hurt all over again. Rinse, wash, repeat. Over and over and over.

While you are going through this, you need to make a conscious effort to make sure that you‚Äôre doing all the things that you need to do to keep alive. Eating actual vegetables, getting exercise, washing yourself, changing your clothes, getting sunshine.

And it will suck, but as trite as it is, it gets better. Someone makes a stupid joke, and you laugh. The hole they left will fill with the memories you had. The colour will eventually come back in, little by little.

Hope you‚Äôre okay there OP.",2021-09-10 11:30:11

   I also have bipolar mood disorder and ADHD  (both pre-existing) which have become more difficult to control because of the traumatic brain injury. 
   
   There is no gross functional impairment due to the TBI, but I guess some people would say I've changed. I know I now struggle to read recreationally, where as I used to enjoy a good book every week or two. I just can't seem to keep the plot threads together now like I used to. 
   
   I'm on 11 different medications to help control my psychiatric illnesses. I've done meds reviews where I wean off everything to see how I cope without meds, and they end badly, so I am more or less certain that whatever the cause, I am ill and need medicine to assist in keeping me a functional and productive adult. Just like any other chronic illness. 
   
   Luckily I have had a very good support structure, a good Psychiatrist and therapist and received the appropriiate treatment.

Comment,1,hcafmyc,,0,1631263187.0,"Kobe Bryant‚Äôs death hit me the hardest because of how tragic it was. Many basketball fans knew that he always went everywhere with his helicopter, but who would ever expect that he would die from one. It was also the day after LeBron passed him on the all-time scoring list and they were both being talked about on ESPN. 

The fact that his daughter died as well was just so heartbreaking and it still feels unreal to this day. Both she and Kobe had so much ahead of them you‚Äôd never think they would in a million years be dead.

Comment,1,hcafmry,,0,1631263183.0,"You my friend, have the easiest issue to solve.  Students are expected to learn and explore. Take it from a long-time academic turned professional (with an interdisciplinary career between several 'most challenging fields').

The question is, ""Are you being productive?""  If you spend a couple months learning additional biochemical kinetics, it's directed study. If you write, you're practicing your trade. Trying to do a little programming to see if it's right for you? Great. Helping out at a non-profit, food-bank, or literally any other place can be a great way to see how different economic sectors work. Nearly anything you do while in college can be framed successfully. Even starting music lessons can be rationalized, and could help jumpstart a healthy work/life balance for your career. (If you took a full load and a half of classes, would the question of not working even be an issue?)

Here's the caveat... Beer pong and TV do not count. You actually have to be productive in one way or another. Just be honest about it.",2021-09-10 11:39:43

Comment,1,hcafll2,,0,1631263153.0,"Yes. 

I always thought I fell in love a lot. I did it over and over again. I actually thought love wasn't ""chemistry"" and ""fireworks"", it was just companionship and strong friendship. All that ""magic"" claptrap was from Hollywood and Disney. I got married, I got divorced. Married again, divorced again. Still hopeful though, because I fell in love easily.

Then I met him. I fiiiinally understood what I had been missing. It all finally made sense. Nothing in my life was ever like this before. Yes, there is companionship - the most satisfying sort of comfortable togetherness. Yes, there is friendship - the best and strongest of my life. But it is so much more. Soooo much more. He is everything to me, and I am to him too. 6 years into the (I now know) only love of my life, we got married. And still, six years in, I smile just to look at him. I smile going to sleep every night with him beside me. I smile waking up every morning because he's there. Magic is right, fireworks are right. It's all there. We can't get enough of each other, and we never get sick of hanging out together. He is my best friend and the best person I have ever known.

Nothing has ever felt like this before. Even if it feels like love, even if it hurts - true love is a million times better, and a million times more worth it.

Comment,1,hcafhao,,0,1631263047.0,"Amstrad CPC 464 way back in the day. After a while I moved onto Commodore Amiga, realised the supplied Basic interpreter wasn't going to do it. I bought a book at some trade show or computer show about Amiga Assembler. I stuck with it and got a really good understanding of assembler in general. Right at the end of the book it told me to go off and learn C. I went off and ordered a couple of books from the back of CU Amiga and went from there.

This was all before I did my A-Level Computing. Back then, the A-Level was primitive and I was surprised when my first homework assignments were handed back with D's and E's (quite low grades). I was annoyed as I knew perfectly well what a stack was, what a queue was and what an accumulator was, what the program counter did, yada yada.

Eventually I figured out that what the teacher wanted was that when a homework question was given, we essentially re-write what was in the book just using a different form of words regardless of whether or not it was applicable in all situations or not. Like I say, the A-Level in Computing was pretty ill thought out and seemed to be based on one single book. Any deviation from the rubric whatsoever would cost you grades even if you were correct and it addressed the question. Stupid really. It was literally take a sentence, rewrite it in different words, there is the answer.

There were a couple of pseudo-code based questions but the question did say ""in any language"". I remember I handed in one answer based entirely on Amiga Assembler. He graded it F as he claimed it was not a real language. I did plead with my parents to let me bring in my Amiga to show him the full working code but it never happened. My five minutes of glory were not to be. I went back to handing in coding assignments in pseudocode and left it at that, it wasn't worth the headache as there would be no glorious victory.

While I understand that learning parrot-fashion can be effective, the whole exercise made me question continuing it. Thankfully the exam itself wasn't quite as stupid and was not based on one single book.",2021-09-10 11:37:27

Comment,1,hcafh3h,,0,1631263041.0,"Twin Peaks is what you‚Äôd call a ‚Äúgenre buster‚Äù: you‚Äôll find horror, comedy / slapstick humor, romance, with a touch of 90s quirkiness that you can‚Äôt find in today‚Äôs shows (times have changed since the first two seasons aired, obviously).

The characters largely contribute to the show. Each and everyone of them has their own personality and ambitions (or lack thereof) and pushes the story forward. Even the small town of Twin Peaks feels alive.

Another major point to consider is that back in the day when it aired for the first time, Twin Peaks was a novelty. The show was the first (please correct me if I‚Äôm wrong) to offer a main plot that spread across entire seasons, whereas previous TV shows used to wrap up their intrigues by the end of this week‚Äôs episode.

Lastly, there‚Äôs this campy feel when you watch an episode after getting back from work. Once you hear the opening theme, you know you‚Äôre out of our reality and into another where dreams and nightmares coexist and share cherry pie and black-as-a-moonless-night coffee.",2021-09-10 11:37:21

Comment,1,hcafgwu,,0,1631263036.0,"Working in a hotel bar for a luxury hotel.
Had a guy come in around 3 in the morning. Really nothing was happening anymore since it was the middle of the week. He sat down opposite of me and ordered 2 bottles of champagne (for the last 2 guests that were still around) order two cocktails for my colleague and I and afterwards our most expensive Whiskey (Johnnie Walkers King George) which we sell at a solid 75‚Ç¨ per 4cl.... he proceeded to drink half of the bottle being around 40 cl (so 750 bucks only for the whiskey). Later he ended up telling us his wife cheated on him with his best friend, took the kids to leave for her mothers house and he had no other real friends to turn to since all he did was work.

Holy shit I felt awful listening to the guy as you could tell that his life was 100% ruined
He ended up spending around 1200 bucks on drinks and a little to eat and gave a 200‚Ç¨ tip when he was about to leave thanking us for listening...

I really hope he's doing better and atleast got his kids or something. Seemed like a nice guy...

The way it was phrased definitely felt very patronizing, and they were also perpetuating false stereotypes around MSG. They were trying to benefit from Chinese culture while simultaneously putting it down. A more recent example would be a group who tried to redesign mahjong tiles while putting down the original, traditional designs.

Yes, that was my biggest gripe with Resurgence.  We fell in love with the characters in ID4, we got their stories and relationships and we invested in them and that was a HUGE part of how the movie makes you feel.  

I felt the characters were very lazily portrayed in Resurgence and I definitely didn't feel a bond to any of them except - of course - those who had also been in ID4.  LOVED Dr. Oken!",2021-09-10 11:34:10

I could have been more clear on the phone yet my brain mentally shit itself in the moments afterwards. I was in shock.

I'd also buy properties for my friends to live in free of charge and offer them well paying jobs working with my animals if they wished or help them go back to uni to learn a new career that they would enjoy.

Comment,1,hcaf5h5,,0,1631262747.0,"Assuming its really mine;

Get my nan into a top dog care home for alzheimers. Buy her house off her for far more than its worth so we dont lose her house (sentimental to us) and she gets awesome care in a 5 star facility. 
Do up her house as I currently live there, with a disabled room downstairs and bathroom so nan can sleep over our house two or three nights a week so that way she's always got a connection to home.

Meanwhile, buy land nearby and start plans to build my dream home.   
Gather the 10 most trusted people I know and give them an ultimatum, either they all get a million each in a trust fund they can access for anything they want with the promise they NEVER tell anyone where they got the money and must say they won it on a scratch card or an estranged rich aunt died and left them cash. If anyone refuses, no one gets anything. If I find out they told someone its come from me, they're cut off. 

I'd give secret gifts to family and friends, and probably lie after a while and say I won a small amount of money that I have to keep tight if I never want to work again.   

Pay off my and my partners student debts.  

Become a financial backer for my partners firm,he works in film and they have so many good ideas and work so hard but getting funding to do their jobs and not need part time work is bleh. I could make them their own studios with all the kit and support their first 5 films with % back on the return so that I can keep supporting them.

With a bunch of the rest of money? Donate to charities. At least million to cancer research and alzheimers research.  Maybe set up better more affordable care homes here. Our population is just getting older and they need GOOD care. Not basic care. And affordable care that wont fuck people out of their inheritances :(",2021-09-10 11:32:27

Comment,1,hcaf4dy,,0,1631262718.0,"That‚Äôs a fair definition. 

Human cultures exist where people are nomads without a fixed place to live, cultures exist where accommodation is shared by several groups, cultures exist where people live communally.

That says to me that a fixed place ‚Äúbelonging‚Äù to one person or family unit that is their permanent shelter and store of possessions‚Ä¶. That‚Äôs a product of culture with cultural variations and even cultures where it doesn‚Äôt exist. That makes it a social construct, no?",2021-09-10 11:31:58

I‚Äôve made a lot of life choices that haven‚Äôt been great because it‚Äôs like I‚Äôve been selfish, prioritizing what I want and not what I actually need. I often do this with my mental health.

Comment,1,hcaf3n9,,0,1631262699.0,"Costco gasoline stations are the cheapest gas you'll usually find, so they're always packed. These gas stations are usually large and have several lanes and three pumps per lane. It irks me when people take their sweet time when there are so many people are waiting, but that's to be expected. These are, what Bill Burr calls, ""in-the-way-people"" But what really pisses me off is that one idiot that stops right in the middle of the entrance to the lanes. Let me explain. Costco gasoline stations are usually located adjacent the Costco warehouse in the parking lot. Because there is so much demand, a long line forms snaking though the parking lot just to enter the gasoline station. Because the lanes within the gas station are backed up, the cars entering have to choose which ever lane seems least full as they come in. This means you may end up going to the nearest lane to the entrance or the one farthest. You would think people would be intelligent enough to choose the lane which is least full, but NOOOO. They all bunch up in the lanes nearest the entrance. Yeah, in-the-way-people. So, the entrance is the bottleneck to the whole thing. Here's what pisses me off to no end: There is always an embarrassment to mankind that blocks the very entrance to the gas station itself. The person could've easily been off to the left or right to allow for other cars to get through, or they could have moved inward to one of the lanes farther in, but NOOOO. They choose the obviously crowded lane near the entrance which is so backed up it leaves them blocking entry for everyone else thus stopping all traffic from flowing in until this one lane is able to move forward. In the meantime pumps are freeing up in other lanes but there are no cars to take them. I always feel like getting out of my car, walking over, pulling them out of their car, getting in, and driving it over to a less crowded lane at the farther end. Then hand them their keys with a slap to the face.",2021-09-10 11:31:39

Comment,1,hcaf2fa,,0,1631262667.0,"The brooch my granny gave me while she was still alive. I had an extremely messed up childhood and she was the one singular family member who treated me well and actually wanted to spend time with me. My most fond and vivid memories are from her. I am missing I would say 80% of my memories before the age of 13 due to extensive abuse but I remember all of the time I spent with my granny in perfect detail. I even have a photographic map of her house in my head that is basically my happy place, especially the back yard.

The brooch was a birthday gift. It was two frogs, because she was more obsessed with frogs than I've ever seen anyone obsessed with anything. Her house looked like one of those homes of people with world record collections, but smaller and with frogs. I remember her telling me that she wouldn't be around forever and that she wanted me to have some of her frogs to remember her by. I took that brooch with me everywhere but it fell off my bag on the bus I presume. I only noticed after it had already pulled away. I never saw it again. It's definitely the thing I regret losing most in my life. 

Great I am crying now, I fucking miss you Granny. God dammit. You didn't deserve to die so early.",2021-09-10 11:31:07

She takes me to this office that she rents. She does not own a business of any kind. She just rents this old office that belonged to a dentist back in 1925. Smoked glass doors, transom, etc.  
This office is filled with random Goodwill clothes. I mean thousands and thousands of dresses, pants, suits, etc. Heaped against the walls.  
This cloth, it turns out, is a sort of soundproofing. She rents the office and goes there at night so she can roll around on the floor and scream.

Lol you're totally fine!

It is only legal medicinally here, so you have to pay a doctor whatever their fee is to confirm you have a medical condition that makes you eligible. You then have to pay the state $25 for a card, and an additional $125 for a cultivation license as well. Cards must be renewed every year

You can have 6 plants flowering, 6 plants in veg, and 6 clones at a time, as a single patient (you can apply to become a caregiver for other card holders and grow more plants at a time). There's a limit on how much you can buy from a dispensary in a month, and how many plants you can grow like I mentioned, but *not* on how much you can have in your private residence. My last grow was 2-3lbs of bud :)

Afterward, one of the burglars also sexually assaulted the youngest daughter, and tied both of them to their beds, doused them in gasoline (while they were still alive) as well as the house, and set everything on fire.

Comment,1,hcgsy7g,,0,1631386439.0,"I think being calm and having a lot of patience is the best thing you can do. Just learn when they really need validation. I think sometimes it's a habit and sometimes it's an actual need from the person wanting it. Maybe at some point in a good moment try to talk about that matter, understand the motive of that need. Also Therapy, but that's not something you can make them go to. It's just that you can't do what a therapist could to help them. Most people get annoyed and that's understandable, but showing that you're annoyed just makes the need of validation more intense in my eyes.",2021-09-11 21:53:59

Celebration is something that we do when we are happy or thankful that something happened, mourning is when we are sad or grieving, and remembering could be either, but more likely refers to a sad event or a random fact.

Comment,1,hcgssbz,,0,1631386368.0,"It was only for large apt complexes and they contracted with a company called valet living. The idea is to have a 30gal trash can for each unit. Garbage and recycle are left outside each door and a ""valet"" comes by between 6-10pm and collects it. It's loaded in a employee (not company) pickup truck and driven to the dumpsters on site which are locked to prevent residents from loading and creating a mess. 

Service was sunday-thurs

The service costs about $30/month per unit and it part of the lease

Valet living is a nation wide company actually

They also provide other services like stocking pet waste stations, litter pick up and quarterly building cleaning for areas like stairs/railings.

It's definitely an interesting and very profitable business plan

I definitely have my grievances about he company and the residents often hated the service but I'm not going to bad mouth them in public",2021-09-11 21:52:48

Comment,1,hcgsp4x,,0,1631386330.0,"My wedding was traditional, but on the small side. I think we had somewhere around 50 or 60 guests. It was a very nice ceremony in a lovely little white New England church. The reception was at a local social club that I was a member of. It was also about as traditional as could be. We had an open bar, but with such a small crowd, it wasn‚Äôt too expensive.

We didn‚Äôt do anything crazy that would inflate the cost, and we also paid cash (parents didn‚Äôt have money to help, which was just fine). That is to say, we planned and budgeted it so as to not incur any lasting debt. My wife is very good with money and had it all figured out, including the dress, the rings and the rehearsal dinner.

So, looking back some quarter century, was our small-ish wedding the right choice? Absolutely. We had the traditional ceremony and dignified reception we both wanted, yet we avoided going in too deep and hobbling ourselves with debt. It was just right.",2021-09-11 21:52:10

When the CDC revises their guidelines for schools (which is hugely impactful because schools across the country follow every word) to please a teachers union, you're argument fails.  When the White House mandates vaccines for all employees except for USPS, it fails.  When the White House excludes those crossing the border, it fails.  When science gets set aside because it doesn't match someone's agenda, it fails.  Remember exposed emails from last year that revealed what the experts were telling Fauci back in April and May, but he chose to disregard them?  It fails.",2021-09-11 21:52:06

I guess I just always grew up with the idea that relationships should be between two consenting adults and that the exclusivity of it creates the strength and security of the bond.  Openly, I never voice this opinion beyond saying that it's definitely not my cup of tea.  But it still bothers me even hearing about it.

Comment,1,hcgslfc,,0,1631386286.0,"To me it was something i always had with me since the day i learned how to read. It wasn't in the form of writing then though, more of an unsatiable will to read. I tried writing my first fantasy stories when i was 11. They generally ended with me cringing out of my ass the following day so i always ended up ripping the pages from my notebooks. It was until i turned 16-17 when i sent my stories to professional authours after an atelier. You can guess my excitement when my story got accepted in the top four out of 150 stories. The literature teachers at my highschool were incredible people, it really is all thanks to them that i could rebuilt my courage to get my pen in my hand again. I've been writing in an amateur magazine weekly for a year now, and i am graduating highschool as a four year member of the student literary award comitee. One of my articles got published in a professional internet journal and my stories even got published after being awarded in  literary events.

Long thing short, even if it's a gift, writing is a blade you should always be sharpening through time. None would be able to put up a decent text together by sheer talent. Not only that, but seminars can only help to a certain degree, the only way to write is to read isn't it?",2021-09-11 21:51:26

Comment,1,hcgsleb,,0,1631386286.0,"""Evil"" is a false term created to give direction for morals for humans.

Other animals don't see good or evil, or it's implications.

Dogs for instance don't think humans are evil, even after being beaten, starved, and neglected. Those kinds of characteristics are prevalent in what we would call evil, though.

Morally speaking, mentally handicapped people are incapable of being evil due to genetic defections or medical injuries.

Thusly the terms good and evil cannot truly exist. Evil is your own creation and arguably whatever ""pure evil"" constitutes as is based on your own morality rather than any sort of scale.

However, given how humans typically are, I would surmise that any individual in a position of power who willingly damages or destroys, maimes, or deprives creatures of life constitutes as pure evil.


My number 1 choice of ""pure evil"" would have to go to the numerous people who know that the rapid expansion of human civilization as well as the oil industries.

These people KNOW they are making the world harder to live in and they simply don't care. They care more about their precious ""money"" than the lives of their children or the lives of any living creature. 

These people know how global warming is being directly affected by their industry, but they would protect that industry with the ferocity of a caged and wounded animal. They have continually lobbied so they can maintain the course of history.

__THESE PEOPLE WOULD RATHER SEE THE WORLD BECOME A DESOLATE PLANET THAN LIFT A FINGER TO TRY AND SAVE IT__

And that's my two cents.",2021-09-11 21:51:26

We got married at the courthouse just the 2 of us. And then we had a small wedding in my husband's dad and stepmom's backyard which was covered in fall colors. We had 30 people including us. My brother was the officiant, my husband's sister and her boyfriend sang, my husband's step niece was the flower girl, and my husband's dad and stepmom's dog was our ring dog. For food we had a potluck with BBQ and our cake was 3 Cheesecake Factory Cheesecakes. And then the day ended with a bonfire.

I believe in science and listen to medical experts.  I have a Facebook friend who is a genuine PhD bearing expert in a relevant medical field and whose husband works for Pfiezer.  She and the news reports helped reassure me that this was being fast-tracked due to sh\*t loads of cash and resources being thrown at it rather than due to any corners being cut.  If anything it got MORE research done on it because of all the countries pouring money into it.

I got the vaccine as soon as I possibly could, and I will immunise my special needs son as soon as he either becomes old enough to qualify under the current UK vaccine rules or they lower the age range to include his age group.  I want him vaccinated not just for his own safety, but for the safety of the carers and school staff who work with him, his fellow pupils (some of whom are medically vulnerable), and the other vulnerable folk that the carers come into contact with.

Covid-19 can kill.  I don't want anyone in our family to be responsible for passing on something that causes someone to die.

Comment,1,hcgsgmw,,0,1631386229.0,"Might be a little late, and I hope the person that I had this experience with doesn‚Äôt have Reddit. But‚Ä¶

I was, probably, 15 at the time. I was at my Dad‚Äôs house for a summer. My stepmom had these friends who were gay, let‚Äôs call them ‚ÄúA‚Äù and ‚ÄúB‚Äù. Well, A was like this super laid back guy. Was into all kinds of music, which is how we became super good friends. We‚Äôd talk Marilyn Manson, Alice Cooper, NIN, all types of music. B was this dry, sarcastic, ‚Äúbitchy‚Äù type of gay man(I really don‚Äôt want to offend anyone) B‚Äôs nickname was ‚Äúqueenie‚Äù. So anyway, A and B are over, we‚Äôre all in the pool at my Dad‚Äôs, and it‚Äôs getting close to dinner. We were all going to eat, then just hang out at this little outdoor fest that was going on.

My Dad is like, ‚ÄúHey, go change, come down to eat, and we‚Äôll go.‚Äù Sweet. I‚Äôm headed upstairs, and B is following me up. He had to change, too‚Ä¶and the other bathrooms were in use. I walk into my room, and B is like, ‚ÄúJust give me your shorts and you can change.‚Äù I kind of froze. Like, he was almost blocking the doorway, hand out, like he expect me to drop trow and give him my trunks. I‚Äôm doing some quick thinking‚Ä¶all the while, B is just standing there, tapping his toes, hand out, looking at me with this serious face. I sunk back a bit. All I could think of was, ‚ÄúIf B touches me/makes a move, I will punch this dude dead in his face!‚Äù

I blinked, and realized, the bathroom is right behind him, and the door is open. Found my out! I let B know, ‚ÄúYo, I‚Äôll step into the bathroom, change in there, and leave my trunks on the floor.‚Äù I grabbed my clothes, and bee lined it past him.

For the rest of the night, B had this pissed off vibe whenever I would speak. Like, he was trying to get something, didn‚Äôt get it, and now‚Ä¶had to let me know he ‚Äúhated‚Äù me.

I‚Äôm now in my late 30‚Äôs, and‚Ä¶anytime my stepmom mentions that A and B are coming over, I automatically have plans for that day so, I can‚Äôt make it.",2021-09-11 21:50:29

She was buying clothes, stuff from the garden center, office supplies, one or two pieces of that overpriced patio furniture that you always ask: ""why would you buy this from a Long's?"" Probably some food and paper products. Honestly, it seemed like a few things from every aisle.

Also, Long's is weird. It's got way more everyday type items than your average CVS or Duane Reade type drug store. But it's also much smaller than a Walmart or Target. So you generally wouldn't go there for back to school clothes shopping (but other school supplies, yes).",2021-09-11 21:50:10

Comment,1,hcgsem5,,0,1631386204.0,"I have cystic acne. My very first recommendation would be to consult your doctor, they could provide antibiotics, cremes and in severe cases accutane. When it comes to The Ordinary I highly recommend Niacinamide, which works wonders to even out the skin, reduce scarring and redness. It also gets rid of impurities. In the beginning you might experience a ‚Äùpurge‚Äù, it looks worse before it looks better. It has been like a god-sent for me. I use it both day- and night time. I use The Ordinary‚Äôs Rose seed oil at night as it calms the skin and gives it moisture. Both of these are recommended for acne-prone skin on their website. There are more products you could try, check out their site.

Comment,1,hclo5o3,,0,1631475746.0,"I'm not sure why people fuss about the father's opinion. The baby isn't born yet, meaning it isn't exactly living. It has yet to form any bond or connection to the father, besides it being made out of his sperm. Who is doing the carrying of the child? Who is going through morning sickness? Who is getting the swollen feet? Who is going into labor? The mom. What does the dad do while the baby is being created? Best case, helping the mother while physically feeling the same. It reminds me of how some doctors don't let women get a hysterectomy without husband's permission or already having kids, while men can get the snip with near to no question. And I do feel bad for the men who want an abortion but the mother doesn't. I see a lot of people saying he just should have wore a condom, but those aren't 100% reliable. If the mother wants the baby, she wants the baby and she can be responsible for it. It's like buying a dog without telling anyone and throwing the responsibility on your parents/roommate/partner/whatever. Though totally different case if the mother lives in a place where abortion is illegal.",2021-09-12 22:42:26

Comment,1,hclo0id,,0,1631475689.0,"I was talking to some guy at one of my SO‚Äôs friends Christmas parties I get dragged to every year. Anyway, somehow the topic of gaming PCs and computer hardware comes up and he‚Äôs telling me how excited he is because he just bought the new ryzen 7 to replace his old i5 and how he can‚Äôt wait to get more than 60 FPS on cs:go. I immediately had my doubts about this whole idea of his so I asked him what motherboard he had bought, and he said he didn‚Äôt need a new motherboard, he was just gonna use the same one that was already in the pc as it still worked fine. Even though I tried to explain to him that he would need a new motherboard for the amd processor, he kept insisting his motherboards processor slot would work with any processor and didn‚Äôt want to listen to me as I was trying to get him to ‚Äúwaste money‚Äù. At this point, I didn‚Äôt even bother to mention his monitors refresh rate was probably 60 hz, and that buying a 120 or 144 hz was a must for an increased frame rate. I just went and watched football in the den with all the other dudes and called it a night on socializing. 

Note: for clarification, he had 2 big errors in his logic. First, If his frame rate would not exceed 60 flat that signifies a 60hz refresh rate, which means max of 60 frames per second. In order to increase frames, he would need a monitor with higher refresh rate, which he most likely did not know. Second, because he was switching to an amd processor from an intel processor, his motherboard was and intel motherboard, and he would have to go buy an amd motherboard for his new processor for it to work.",2021-09-12 22:41:29

What we didn't expect was a VERY evenly and well tannned, mid-60's gentleman in nothing but hiking boots and a sun hat.  At the trailhead.  

I don't know why that was so shocking.  We had about 1.5 miles from the trailhead to the springs so I guess it was just so unexpected.

I had no idea why he was so mad. I went up to Buffalo to visit my dads side of the family like 5 years ago. My grandad was cool af but I didn‚Äôt really anything to say to my father. I also have like 5 younger brothers and one older brother that I have never met. I think my dad not being a part of my life was probably for the best.

Comment,1,hclnna9,,0,1631475546.0,">But when it comes to rationing, they absolutely should be bottom billing. Not because of the punishment factor, but because the survival of an anti-vaxxer over the survival of somebody who has a surgery postponed is a travesty.

Interesting that you label them anti-vaxxer. If someone has all their other vaccines but has hesitation specifically about the newly released mRNA vaccines, does that necessarily make them an anti-vaxxer? 

I love the Covid vaccines but I'm not sure we should label people anti-vaxx unless they are truly against vaccines in general. 

I declined a tetanus booster even though the CDC advises them because I was aware that the UK's NHS and the WHO says they're unnecessary. I would hope that I wouldn't be labeled ""anti-vax"" by doctors (or future doctors like yourself) for declining it. 

Thankfully, harmful vaccines are rare, but there have been instances: [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/concerns-history.html](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/concerns-history.html)

Would you have labeled anyone who raised concerns about particular vaccines when they were still new as ""anti-vax,"" even in the rare instances where their concerns turned out to be well-founded?",2021-09-12 22:39:06
